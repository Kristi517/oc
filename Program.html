  <div class="cell cell-2"><h3>Program Information</h3>Office Careers provides one-on-one learning that is highly interactive between the student and instructor.  Our training is designed to be relaxed and social with no prerequisites for computer skills.  We want the student to enjoy their class time and develop useful skills that they will retain and easily apply in a new career direction.  Students will develop new skills by applying them immediately to coursework activities and continuous reinforcement.  These are key factors for the adult learner.

  <div class="cell cell-4"><h3>Class Structure</h3> Students attend class M-F remotely.  We try to use examples that students can connect with their past work experiences.  By using a secondary monitor, instructors are able to display all kinds of examples for coursework that the student will then use the MS Office programs to organize.<br>
    <br>
  We mainly deliver our training by providing specially configured laptops that can be reset without loss of training time and completed student coursework. Using various programs, we are able to talk to students over the computer and see and control what programs they are using.  All they will need to do is turn the computer on at their scheduled class time.</div>
